# AdwordsApp

This project was made as an assignment fo the recruitment process with Cobiro ApS.

The focus was on creating a basic application capable of communicating with the API and a functional user interface.
Authentication was implemented in the most basic way that would allow using the API and needs further development,
such as maintaining the authentication token after a page reload and using the refresh token to keep the session alive.
CanActivate should be implemented to block access to areas of the site requiring authentication to use.

The largest difficulty was interacting with the unfamiliar API - figuring out hw to use it correctly was what took the most time
and I was unable to link an Adwords account.
